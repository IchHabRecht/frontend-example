# Example frontend project

This is a documentation for my future self how to set up and run a frontend project using webpack and Tailwind CSS.

## Initialize project files

- add a basic HTML 5 `index.html` with a single headline

- initialize a bare `package.json` for npm dependency management

```
npm init
```

## *webpack* - a static module bundler for modern JavaScript applications

### Install

- add `webpack` as dev dependency

```
npm install -D webpack@^5.38
```

- add a bare `webpack.config.js` webpack configuration file

    - add an empty `src/index.js` file
